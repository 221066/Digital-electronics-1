## 4-bit binary comparator:
### design.vhd; Comparator architecture
```vhdl

architecture Behavioral of comparator_4bit is
begin
    
    B_greater_A_o <= '1' when (b_i > a_i) else '0';
    B_equals_A_o <= '1' when (b_i = a_i) else '0';
    B_less_A_o   <= '1' when (b_i < a_i) else '0';
   
end architecture Behavioral;
